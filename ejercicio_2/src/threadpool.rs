/*
execute will send a job from the ThreadPool to the Worker 
instances, which will send the job to its thread. 

Here is the plan:

1-The ThreadPool will create a channel and hold on to the 
sending side of the channel.
    
2- Each Worker will hold on to the receiving side of the channel.
    
3-Weâ€™ll create a new Job struct that will hold the closures we want
 to send down the channel.
    
4- The execute method will send the job it wants to execute down 
 the sending side of the channel.

5- In its thread, the Worker will loop over its receiving 
side of the channel and execute the closures of any jobs it receives.
